# Overview
This project focused on developing a scientific calculator in C++ capable of handling basic mathematical operations as well as advanced functions such as trigonometry and graphing. The graphing functionality supports linear and quadratic equations.

My objective for this project was to integrate external libraries to create a sophisticated calculator that is applicable in various real-world scenarios. I successfully designed a user-friendly software interface that allows users to choose between basic calculator functionalities and a scientific calculator with a wide range of operators.

# Development Environment

- C++
- Java
- Python
- MatPlotLib

# Useful Websites

- [CPP Microsoft] https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/?view=msvc-170
- [W3 Schools] https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/

# Future Work

- Develop a working scientific calculator. The library isn't linking correctly, so I need to debug further.
- Incorporate a more visually appealing interface for the user to use the calculator.
- Allow for more operators to be available as well as other special characters. This includes things like pi, lambda, and other graphing functions.
